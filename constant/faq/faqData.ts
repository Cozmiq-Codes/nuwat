    question: "Who Is NUWAT Not A Fit For?",
    answer:
      "We are not a fit for those seeking superficial validation, quick fixes, or standard agency fulfillment. If you are looking to outsource responsibility rather than engage in a transformative partnership, NUWAT is likely not the right environment for you.",

    question: "Do You Offer Fixed Packages Or Pricing?",

    question: "Do You Take On Short-Term Or One-Off Projects?",
    answer:
      "Rarely. On occasion, we may accept a high-leverage strategic audit or specific negotiation support, but our model is built around sustained operational partnership rather than ad-hoc project work.",
